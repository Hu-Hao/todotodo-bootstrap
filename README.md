# todotodo-bootstrap

List of TODO List. This my personal project to learn Backbone, RequireJS, and Twitter Bootstrap.

The code is based from Addy Osmani's [TodoMVC](http://addyosmani.github.com/todomvc/), the one with 
Backbone.JS + RequireJS. I modify it to work with Twitter Bootstrap so it works on desktop and mobile.
